# OPEN-BLACKFIRE / QUANTUM-CLOUD

## Quantum Cloud Service Support

This is a checklist of planned/supported Quantum Cloud services integrated into
OPEN-BLACKFIRE, and will be extended over time until all hardware vendors and
quantum computing service providers are included.

These should be a good start, as they offer decent coverage of current quantum
computing architectures, for both universal and specialized applications:

- [ ] D-Wave
- [ ] IBM Quantum
- [ ] Quantinuum
- [ ] QuiX
- [ ] Rigetti
- [ ] AWS Braket
- [ ] Azure Quantum
